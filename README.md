# ShareSail-Easy Sharing 

It is a web application for sharing files without uploading in google drive or sending it any social media.

Here you need to just upload the file and it will generate a link you just need to share it with that person.

# Cloning a repository using the command line. Follow the directions below:

Open GitHub and go to the GitHub repository that you want to clone.

## Click “Code” and copy the given URL. click code and copy the URL

Open “Git Bash” and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. Type git clone in the terminal, paste the URL you copied earlier, and press “enter” to create your local clone.

Syntax:
```bash
  git clone {repository URL}
```

### To run the client and server after cloning a repository, you need to follow these general steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

#### Change the current working directory to the cloned repository's location. For example, if the repository was cloned to a folder called "my-repo," you can navigate to it using the following command:

bash Copy code cd my-repo Run the server: Depending on the specific project or repository you cloned, there may be different ways to run the server. Run the server first:
```bash
  npm start
```
Open another terminal or command prompt window (while keeping the previous one running) and navigate to the same repository location.

Run the client: Again, depending on the project, there might be different ways to run the client. Look for instructions or documentation provided with the repository. Typically, you might run a command like:

```bash
  npm start
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed and that your local machine meets any prerequisites mentioned in the repository's documentation.
